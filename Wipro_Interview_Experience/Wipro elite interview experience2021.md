My interview experience was smooth but can't say for all , the interviewer was friendly .First the interviewer asked me to introduce myself so I introduced like this : <br>

I'm Avinash Singh pursuing Bachelor of Technonloy from branch computer science & engineering batch -2022 . In 1st year I have studied about Data structure and C language , as we know that data structure is most important skill for computer science student so I have acquired this skill in 1st year.

He was impressed with my intro,after that he asked about projects which was mentioned in my resume so prepare your resume carefully. <br>
Why wipro ? 
I answered that I have heard a lot from my senions that working environment at wipro is very good. <br>
Are you willing to relocate ? I answered yes.<br>
Any preferred location ? I answered any location will work for me.<br>
At last he asked me do you have any question ? I asked about the working environment at wipro , he answered and then we disconnected for further process.<br>
